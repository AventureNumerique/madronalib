To compile the example projects, the following libraries will be needed:

on Windows and MacOS:
JUCE https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE

on Mac OS:
oscpack https://code.google.com/p/oscpack/downloads/list
osctools https://github.com/tap/osctools

getting juce:
I have not forked JUCE. I try to use a recent, unmodified version but not always the latest tip. Currently this JUCE version is commit 9a1171a7ef8cb544df5103101e7ee558323bb80a, so to get it:
git clone https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE.git juce
git reset --hard 9a1171a7ef8cb544df5103101e7ee558323bb80a

getting oscpack:
download from https://code.google.com/p/oscpack/downloads/list

getting osctools:
git clone https://github.com/tap/osctools.git osctools
